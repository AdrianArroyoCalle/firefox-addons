		<p>Today, the CEO at Mozilla says the new and all the online newspapers collect her phrases:
			<ul>
				<li>“Trident is the engine with less bugs in the history of computation”</li>
				<li>“JavaScript? Too fast. We are going to use Visual Basic Script and of course, ActiveX controls”</li>
				<li>“Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, FreeBSD, Windows 7, ... These systems are for bored people. Cool people use Windows, of course, Windows XP SP3”</li>
				<li>“Addons? NO, of course not. The new Firefox generation will come with a interface designed in Visual Basic 6.”</li>
				<li>“IRC Client? IRC is from the past. We're going to use the most advanced comunicated system in the world: Free Hotmail and MSN Messenger”</li>
				<li>WebGL is almost good but the game industry is preocupated so we're going to remove it from the new Firefox generation</li>
				<li>Tabs are from the past. We use <em>Windows</em></li>
			</ul><br>
		The CEO haven't confirmed yet if this decision will apply other Mozilla products like Thunderbird, SeaMonkey, Sunbird, Fennec and Firefox OS.
